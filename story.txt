Once upon a time there was a student named Cam. Cam was dumb and decided to wait till the last minute to complete all of his CS work. Cam at this point in the story has a few hours to finish the rest of it. Only God knows how this one turns out.
Cam put on his big boy pants and worked super hard that night to finish all his work. But since he was very tired, he took a long snooze after.
After he woke up, he realised he didnt submit anything (lol)!
